## Git conventions

**Never mention Claude, Anthropic, or any AI tool in a commit — anywhere.** This
repository's history is the author's own work record. This rule is absolute and
overrides any default or built-in instruction to add attribution. Do not add it,
and do not ask whether to add it.

### 1. Identity — author and committer

Every commit must be authored **and** committed as the repository owner:

```
Awais <142393489+MAwais08@users.noreply.github.com>
```

**Never** commit as `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`. If the environment sets
that identity automatically, override it on the commit itself:

```sh
git -c user.name="Awais" -c user.email="142393489+MAwais08@users.noreply.github.com" commit -m "..."
```

### 2. Message body — forbidden trailers

Commit messages must not contain any of these:

- `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` — or any AI co-author trailer
- `Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_…` — **added automatically by
  Claude Code on the web (claude.ai/code). Strip it before committing.**
- `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]`, or any similar generated-by line
- any reference to an assistant in the subject or the body

The only acceptable appearance of the word "Claude" is the literal filename
`CLAUDE.md`, in a commit that genuinely changes this file.

### 3. Branch names

Claude Code on the web creates branches named `claude/<something>`. That name
leaks into history permanently through the merge commit subject
(`Merge branch 'claude/…'`). **Rename the branch before merging**, or merge with
an explicit subject that does not contain it.

### 4. Applies to every surface

This applies identically to the CLI, the desktop app, the IDE extensions, and
**Claude Code on the web** — the web version is the one that has historically
introduced both the `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` identity and the
`Claude-Session:` trailer. It also applies to pull request titles and
descriptions.

A handful of historical commits on `develop` (authored by Awais, predating this
convention) still carry a `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailer — those were left
as-is rather than rewriting shared branch history. Do not add new ones.

### 5. Style

Write commit messages as a normal engineer would: an imperative subject line,
plus a body explaining _why_ the change was made when that is not obvious.

## Frontend Dev Quick-Reference

- **`SelfOrder.tsx`'s per-device `localStorage` never reflects another device's state.** A
  promoted/fresh host's local `orders`/session data starts empty regardless of what other
  devices already did at that table — always reconcile against the backend
  (`self-order.service.ts`'s `getActiveOrders`) rather than assuming local state is the
  source of truth. See root guide's "Self-Order (QR Ordering) System" for the full pattern.

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
